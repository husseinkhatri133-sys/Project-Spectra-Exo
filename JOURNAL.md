# Project Spectra-Exo — Build Journal

I have finished the mechanical and structural design of Project Spectra-Exo this Gordon, an open frame conversion of the Acer Nitro XV272U X1. (After further research into display panels, I am upgrading the donor monitor from the VG270U to the XV272U X1 today.)

I am starting from a complete theoretical teardown analysis of the monitor to know its internal configuration, first of all where to mount and besides that thermal characteristics.

On this basis, I have designed an aluminum exoskeleton with 2020-series aluminum extrusion.

The dimensions are two 614 mm rails, four 327 mm rails, which are sized to accommodate a 27-inch panel.

It’s strong, this is also modular and adjustible.

In order to provide that it would have a place to accommodate the internal circuitry, I made one rear acrylic mount plate to screw onto the aluminum structural framework.

On this plate, the logic boards of the monitor would be mounted using nylon stand-offs to provide an efficient and streamlined layout to facilitate airflow.

In this way, rather than use the plastic cladding, an open framework is achieved to provide visibility, modularity, and cooling.

With respect to cooling, I would use Thermal Grizzly Minus Pad 8 to increase the conduction from the display controller dies to the surrounding air.

The LCD is arranged without the wrapping, instead having passive convection cooling, where the cooling is passive without any need to use active cooling.

The LCD would be supported through the use of compression cushioned channels, where 1 mm EVA foam is to be placed within the slots of aluminum.

This securely supports the glass without introducing stress concentrations, and to eliminate them altogether, no plastic bezel is to be used.

Lastly, the final assembly would be to be built to be mountable to a gas-spring monitor stand, using the 2020 aluminum structural interface.

It would provide an efficient, highly professional workstation setup while still permitting maximum adjustability.
