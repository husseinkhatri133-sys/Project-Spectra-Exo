# Project-Spectra-Exo
Project Spectra-Exo overhauls an Acer Nitro VG270U X1 into a 2020-series aluminum exoskeleton. It solves the "thermal-trap" flaw of plastic cases using a black acrylic mezzanine and chimney effect for 200Hz logic cooling. Features 1mm EVA foam to float the glass and M4 T-nuts for a modular, repairable open-frame.
