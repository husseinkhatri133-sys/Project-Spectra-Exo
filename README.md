# Project-Spectra-Exo
I am the head of the Engineering Project Spectra-Exo which is a design of an Acer Nitro XV272U X1 (After further research into display panels, I am upgrading the donor monitor from the VG270U to the XV272U X1) in a radical way. The project addresses the fundamental problem with most of the current high-performance displays: the thin and made of plastic thermal traps. I am putting the 2K 200Hz panel into a custom aluminum exoskeleton of 2020-series by eliminating the factory housing. It is not just a shell, it is a modular engineering platform which does its best to maximize thermal stability and long-term mechanical serviceability.

The unit runs at a native rate of 200Hz with a refresh rate, thus the internal logic controller has a high thermal density. In standard cases, the air is stagnant and therefore IC corruption and signal instability can be experienced. This is addressed with a two-layered design of a black acrylic mezzanine and Thermal Grizzly Minus Pad 8 interface materials. Their collective effect is a high -convection chimney effect which takes the heat out of the logic boards and into the atmosphere.

To resist structural load, a roll cage of the black-anodized 2020 aluminum extrusions is created around the fragile 27-inch glass. It is necessary to support the glass panel with a compression-fit cushioned channel, which will prevent the stress fractures that are caused by metals and glasses. High-density EVA foam tape of 1mm high is placed around the channel. This retains the glass tight but secure.

The design is electrically safe having mounted all PCBs on nylon standoffs with M3. This minimizes the occurrence of static risk and physical isolation of the electronics.

T-slot system enables me to fix a gas spring arm and other custom hardware peripheral directly. The system is completely modular using M4 sliding T -nuts.

We are in a time and age of disposable hardware where a broken plastic clip or a failed capacitor is sent out to landfill. Spectra plan creates a transparency, modular, and repairable hardware as demonstrated by Spectra-Exo. The project has enabled me to acquire the skills of mechanical CAD, thermal management, and precision fabrication.
